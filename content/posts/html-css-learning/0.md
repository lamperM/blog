# Get start
* HTML is resonsible for the content of the page. That's the text, images, buttons, etc.
* CSS is resonsible for the presentation of the content. That's the color, layout, etc.

## Configure VIM as HTML code-editor
Add vim plugin:
* [emmet](https://emmet.io/): Coding faster.

## Anatomy of an HTML element

```html
<p> THML is a markup language</p>
```
The HTML element is composed of `opening tag`, `content`, `closing tag`.


## HTML tips

* `<img/>` element should add `alt` attritube at all time, for the convenience of the blind.
* An important principle in web design is `making the HTML elements meaningful`. That is [semantic HTML](https://www.thoughtco.com/why-use-semantic-html-3468271).

# F\*\*king CSS
CSS describes the visual style and presentation of the contend in HTML.

## Anatomy of an HTML element

```css
h1 {
    color: blue;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 20px;
}
```
h1 is `Seletor`, every `style` has `proporty` and `value`.

## Conflicts between selectors
CSS style priority from high to low: 
1. Inline style(style attribute in HTML)
2. ID selector
3. class or pseudo-class selector
4. element selector
5. universal element selector

## The CSS box model
The box model defines how elements are displayed on a webpage and how they are sized.  
In the box model, every element on a webpage can be seen as a rectangular box.

## Universal element & `<body>` element
Styles in `<body>` selector take effect because of inheritance. But the text-independent elements do not support inheritance.  
That is where *universal element* selector is needed. It's styles take effect on all element. 

When we want to set  padding and margin of all elements to `0`. Must put the code in universal element selector.

## CSS tips
* Class selector is more commonly used than ID selector, as `ID` is *unique* in HTML. For scalability, **remember always using class selector**.
* We should always specify all the four state of `<a>` element in order, which including `link`, `visited`, `hover` and `active`.
