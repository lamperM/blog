# Get start
## What is HTML&CSS?
* HTML is resonsible for the content of the page. That's the text, images, buttons, etc.
* CSS is resonsible for the presentation of the content. That's the color, layout, etc.

* Web **designers** create the overall look and fell of a website.
* Web **developers** implement the design using **HTML, CSS and JavaScript code**.

## Configure VIM as HTML code-editor
> Finally in the arms of `vscode` :hear_no_evil:

Add vim plugin:
* [emmet](https://emmet.io/): Coding HTML faster.

CSS autocomplete key: `<C-x> <C-o>`

HTML and CSS live previes plugin: [bracey](https://github.com/turbio/bracey.vim)
* [urlopen error solution](https://github.com/turbio/bracey.vim/issues/21)

# HTML Fundamentals
## Anatomy of an HTML element

```html
<p> THML is a markup language</p>
```
The HTML element is composed of `opening tag`, `content`, `closing tag`.


## HTML good styles

* `<img/>` element should add `alt` attritube at all time, for the convenience of the blind.
* An important principle in web design is `making the HTML elements meaningful`. That is [semantic HTML](https://www.thoughtco.com/why-use-semantic-html-3468271).

# CSS Fundamentals
CSS describes the visual style and presentation of the contend in HTML.

## Anatomy of an HTML element

```css
h1 {
    color: blue;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 20px;
}
```
h1 is `Seletor`, every `style` has `proporty` and `value`.

## CSS good styles
* Class selector is more commonly used than ID selector, as `ID` is *unique* in HTML. For scalability, **remember always using class selector**.
* We should always specify all the four state of `<a>` element in order, which including `link`, `visited`, `hover` and `active`.

## Priority conflicts between selectors
CSS style priority from high to low: 
1. Inline style(style attribute in HTML)
2. ID selector
3. class or pseudo-class selector
4. element selector
5. universal element selector


&nbsp;
# The CSS box model
The box model defines how elements are displayed on a webpage and how they are sized.  
In the box model, every element on a webpage can be seen as a rectangular box.

&nbsp;
# Universal element & `<body>` element
Styles in `<body>` selector take effect because of inheritance. But the text-independent elements do not support inheritance.  
That is where *universal element* selector is needed. It's styles take effect on all element. 

When we want to set  padding and margin of all elements to `0`. Must put the code in universal element selector.

&nbsp;
# Inline elements & Block elements
Inline elements:
* Occupies only the space necessary for its content.
* Box model applies in different way: **heights and widths do no apply**.
* Paddings and margins are applied **only horizontally**(left and right).

Block elements:
* 100% of parent's width
* vertivally, one after another

Inline-Block elements:
* Good example is `<img>`.

# The 3 ways of building layouts with CSS
`Float Layouts`: The **old way of building layouts**, using the float CSS property. Still used, but getting outdated fase.
* Element is removed from the normal flow: *out of* flow. Like absolutely positioning.
* Text and inline elements will wrap around the floated elements. Different from absolutely elements.
* The container will *NOT* adjust its height to the elements.

`FlexBox`: Modern way of laying out elements in a **1-dimensional row** without using floats. Prefect for **component layouts**.
* One of its most useful applications is **vertical centering**.
* Flex container property:
    * `gap`: To create space between items.
    * `justify-content`: To align items along main axis(**horizontally**, by default)
    * `align-items`: To align items along cross axis(**vertically**, by dedauly)
    * `flex-wrap`: To allow items to **wrap into a new line** if they are too large
    * `align-content`: Only applies when there are multiple lines(flex-wrap: wrap)
* Flex Items property:
    * `align-self`: To overwrite align-items for individual flex items.
    * `flex-grow`: To allow an element to **grow**.
    * `flex-shrink`: To allow an element to **shrink**.
    * `flex-basis`: To define an item's width, **instead of the width** property.
    * `flex`: **Recommended shorthand** for flex-grow, -shrink, -basis.

`CSS Grid`: For laying out elements in a fully-fledged **2-dimensional grid**. Perfect for page layouts and complex components.
* CSS grid is a set of **CSS properties** for building **2-dimensional** layouts
* The main idea behind CSS Grid is that we **divide a container element into rows and columns** that can be filled with its child elements
* CSS grid is **not meant to replace flexbox!**. Instead, they work perfectly together. Need a **1D** layouts? Use flexbox. Need a **2D** layout? Use CSS grid

* Grid container
    * grid-template-rows/grid-template-columns: To establish the grid **row and column tracks**. One length uniit for each track. Any unit can be used, new **fr** fills unused space
    * row-gap/colum-gap: To **create empty space** between tracks
    * justify-items/align-items: To align items inside rows/columns(**horizontally/vertically**)
* Grid items
    * grid-column/grid-row: To **place a grid item** into a specific cell, based on line numbers. span keyword can be used to span an item across more cells
    * justify-self/align-self: To **overwrite** justify-items/align-items for single items
