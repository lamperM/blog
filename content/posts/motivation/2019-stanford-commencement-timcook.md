Fourteen years ago, Steve stood on this stage and told your predecessors "Your time is limited. So don't waste is living someone else's life." 

So what is true then is true now. Don't waste your time living someone else's life. 
Don't try to emulate the people who came before you to the exclusion of 
everything else, contorting into a shape that doesn't fit. 

Graduates, the fact is, when your time comes, and it will, you will never be ready.
But you're not suppposed to be. Find the hope in the unexpected. Find the hope
int the challenge. Find your vision on the solitary road. Don't get distracted.
There are too many people who want credit without responsibility. Too many who
show up for the ribbon cutting without building anything worth a damn.

Be different. Leave something worthy. And always remember that you can't take it 
with you. You're going to have to pass it on.

Thank you very much. And Congratulations to the Class of 2019!
